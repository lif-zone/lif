## What is LIF?

A p2p Crypto Network For Creating Trust Between People. Yep, now it's all clear ;-)

LIF is an experimental open-source technology which improves decentralization, security, censorship resistance, privacy, and speed to enable deployment of any data-based application.

(For the technically minded, LIF is a keys/value distribued MongoDB-like database on top of IPFS-like file system, leveraging Bitcoin/Ethernium-like technology)

We envision that all future applicaiton will leverage on the LIF protocl and peer to store it's data.

LIF is combing [IPFS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/ipfs/) with [Mongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) and [Namecoin](https://www.namecoin.org/), that let you create any database distributed application:
- Data is never lost
- Data can always be found (and quicly)
- Data cannot be altered, changed or faked
- You know who is the creator of the data

As soon as there was digital data, there was a need to store it. File systems was the first stage of handlig big perstient data. Once you had data, you needed to a way to access it, aand SQL-based databases was a big jump forward. But SQL DB ws slow and very limitted. When your schema is hard coded, it's very slow and very difficult to change over time.
So the solution was MongoDB. Where there is no static schema. You can pus any data with any format and it is up to the application to decide in run time how to "look" at the data. LIF is a similar breaktrhoug in the blockchain technology. In LIF, anyone can throw any data to the network, no validation at the insert point. Data is validated only when it actually used. This approach to blockchain, completely change the game. With current technology, any transcation or chage to the blockcahin is slow and expensive. With LIF, any transcation is super fast and cheap. We deffer the validation to the moment where data is actually used, and it is up the to the data consumer to validate it. Each block has a verify function (that be defined for any use), and when that data is being used, at the point the verify function is used to verfiy the data.

The main principlas behind the LIP protocol are simple:
- Anyone can push any data to the network
- Data is verifyed when used (not at inseretion point)
- There is a HUGE incentives to all the peers to know the most accurate status of the data

LIF is a **protocol**:
-

LIF is a **distributed document based database**:
-

LIF is **modular**:

LIF uses **crypto**:

LIF is **p2p**:

LIF is a **CDN**:

LIF has **idendity creation*
- You can prove that your are you!

LIF has **a name service**

## Use cases

- **Social Apps:** If you ever used Facebook, you know how annoying, misleading and wrong are the Fact-checkers (Ugh!). Imagine that Facebook data was saved on LIF and anyone could have developed a Facebook-reader application to show the data. A few users would like to have today's censored (fact-checkers) kind of application. Parents may decide to have an app to hide adult content, while free peopole will choose one that doesn't censoer. Up to you. Remeber Parler that was brought down and all data was erased - It coud never happen with LIF!
- **Crypto currency:** Today, your money is not realy yours (if you could really call FIAT money "money"...). What if you could use a currency which is not fake (like all government money). What if you could issue your own money? What if no one could "steal" your money. With LIF, it is possible!
- **Voting system:** Do you trust "Big Brother" votings? Have you ever waching a TV show where the audience votes, and you were sure the the production faked the votes? Are you sure your country voting is legit? Some in the US aren't.... A voting system leverging on the LIF protocaol CAN be trusted by all!
- **Online Passport:** Idenity and Declaration, XXX
- **DNS:** XXX
- Any any application that rely on data...

## License

**LIF License** - Why do you beeieve you need one?! Liberty, Independence, Freedom!
If you want to modify - no problem!

## Current state of LIF

LIF is at the **VERY** early stage of conception. We are just starting. We are still defining the main parts
of the network, how it will work and the API. We plan to come up with initial POC in a few weeks.

## Get involved

We are just starting up, and you are invited to join!
