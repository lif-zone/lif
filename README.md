## What is LIF?

A P2P Crypto Network For Creating Trust Between People. 
Ah, now you got it ;-)

LIF is combing [IPFS](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ipfs/ipfs/) ideas with a [Mongo](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) like interaface, that let you create any database distributed application:
- Data is never lost
- Data can always be found (and quicly)
- Data cannot be altered, changed or faked

## Use cases

- Crypto currency
- Online passport & idenity
- Voting system
- System for official declarations
- DNS
- Social apps
- Any any application that rely on data...
