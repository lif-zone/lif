## What is LIF?
LIF - a technology that provides eternal life to users' declarations, while encouraging trust in the declarations. This in turn creates a Public Read Write Internet, which in turn creates the Public Computer. The network will be implemented by P2P and cryptography technology. The code will be developed by the LIF community in an open source project.

LIF is a declaration storage system that guarantees them eternal life, and contains technologies that prevent disruption, censorship, or retrospective addition. No collective will be able to control, strike or censor it. LIF declarations are time stamped and signed on the scroll, right under the signature of the previous decoration on that scroll.

Everything in LIF is public and visible to all - in contrast to the Internet which is private and hidden by default. LIF creates public memory and public communication, which ensures that your information is stored forever, and enables you to communicate with any man. Thus providing power to man to stand up against the collective, providing man with liberty, enabling man to live his life by his beliefs. The declarant declares his declarations on a scroll in his computer. What is a declaration? a declaration is information (data) with a timestamp and a cryptographic signature of the declarant's personal wallet. And what is a Scroll? a scroll is a file created by the declarant, where declarations are appended and stored sequentially, in a similar way that declarations are written one after the other on a scroll. Scrolls are created by an "opening declaration", then the declarations are appended sequentially, and optionally its closed by a "closing declaration", to prevent declarations appended after scroll closing. Every declaration includes in its signature calculation the signature on the previous declaration in the scroll, to prevent new declarations inserted mid scroll.

Storage, duplication, and distribution of the copies is incentivized by "Save mine and I will save yours". For every GB of scroll storage, the user allocates 10GB storage for saving copies and distributing scrolls of other LIF users. Each user allocates part of his storage to help other users preserve, duplicate and distribute their scrolls. Trust in scrolls is created by notarizing: declaring witnessing a signed declaration in another scroll, providing provable order between two declarations in different scrolls. Timestamping helps further pinpoint the order. B notarizing a declaration from scroll A, proves declarations before the A's declaration notarized, were declared before B's notarization declaration.

This creates a Public Read Internet, where anyone can read anything his fellow man declared. But what about the Write capabilities? Allowing any user to modify declarations of any other user? How is that even possible? "Faith" is the magic that creates the Write capabilities: Eve modifies Adam's homepage by appending her declaration to her own scroll: "Here's Adam's new homepage!". Whoever wants to believe Eve - is free to do so! Whoever chooses not to believe Eve, will ignore Eve's declaration, and will view Adam's homepage unmodified as in his original declaration. What is a Public Computer? a machine capable of performing computational work, input and output (reading and writing to the Public Internet), while enabling the user to trust the output.

How is it possible to build a Public Computer? faith again is the answer: Faith creates the Public Computer. Any man can declare a request to execute a compute job on the Public Computer. An app developer (such as a social media) can declare code that produces an index to data (such as posts of friends of friends). Every computer owner who wishes - can choose to run this requested indexing job, and declare its results. The user side application (written by the app developer, who is also the index requestor) requests all the declarations of the job output, compares them, and if output is identical - it can give some level of trust in the index. The user can increase the amount of trust by increasing the number of output declarations it compares.

## When there is no truth there is no trust
We live in an age of silence. Any declaration that is not considered politically correct and that does not reconcile with the progressive worldview that manages the public discourse at a high level, is silenced and shelved. There is no longer room for a variety of opinions. There is no room for discourse and if the truth does not fit the general melody - there is also no room for the truth.

Today more than ever, collectives have means to crush the individual's freedom of expression by a campaign that presents a lie as absolute truth and truth as a conspiratorial lie. Even if the campaign fails making the public believe the lie, suffice the campaign just hampers man's ability to distinguish between truth and false - to create devastating results. Reducing the ability to separate truth from false, reduces in turn the amount of trust a man can give in his friend and the declarations of his friend. Trust in fellow man is damaged. Thus trust reduced in the community, and in the people. All over in the world trust decreases.

Technology has become a tool of control instead a tool for freedom. But the technology that created the problem is also the one from which salvation will come.

Meet LIF - a technological-political start-up, to promote trust and human freedom.

LIF is a new, decentralized network of declarations - and completely independent, without centralized management like Facebook or Twitter, and without the tyranny of the majority and the complicated judicial mechanism of Blockchain.

The network is based on building trust between users. Any declaration is admissible, but it will be trusted, as long as it is interwoven with additional declarations that have already been trusted and as long as the content of the declaration is true.

LIF is not judgmental and does not try to determine what the truth is, like Fact Checkers and does not try to reach a consensus, or a decision between its users. It simply places people's declarations on top of each other and interweaves them so that they cannot be falsified or altered. What is the truth? This is what each user will use his wisdom and decide for himself. As a result LIF is independent and unopinionated.

The Bible's scroll weaving technology makes it impossible to rewrite even a single letter in Bible due to the 3,000 years of rigorous copying and checksumming technology and delivery from father to son. Likewise LIF's woven digital scrolls make it impossible to falsify a declaration placed in a woven scroll.

Just as different content can be published on the Internet for different uses, the LIF network does not form an opinion, or express a position about the famous declarations that appear in it. You, the users, determine what will appear in it, without censorship.

Technology will allow people to declare and publish anything publicly, in an unequivocal and unchangeable way:}

- It will not be possible to delete the publication. (Prevention of censorshipr

- It will not be possible to change the publication. (Prevention of distortion)

- It will not be possible to publish in retrospect. (Prevention of time stamp forgery).

- There will be certainty about the identity of the advertiser (can not be disputed that you are you)


In contrast to the traditional media that concentrates all its power and dictates the public agenda; in distributed media there are thousands of writers, hundreds of points of view. In decentralized media no group or elite will be able to decide that they want to hide information, or perform gross manipulations of reality.

The result: a world where history cannot be rewritten, or the truth shelved!

## LIF - Liberty Independence Freedom
LIF is a completely new technology, offering a revolutionary direction and correction, of the limitations that exist in today's Internet and blockchain technologies. This is a Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Independent and Unopinionated network to incentivize trust between people. The technology will let every man declare and publicize anything to the whole public, in a way that no collective can modify, block or fake, and will provide trustable proof for declarant and timestamp.

LIF works like in real life. Within a short time, trust will be established in the truthfulness of the content of others' declarations, and for example merchants, who initially examined each other carefully, will later feel confident to operate within the network. As the belief in the immunity of declarations to rewrite is formed, trust will emerge, and the gate to a free economy and abundance will open. Preventing rewrites prevents fraudsters from retrospectively changing history and evading responsibility for their declarations.

## What makes LIF unique?
How did the miracle happen, when millions of copies of the Torah scroll of the Jewish people were distributed all over the world, copied manually from generation to generation and 2000 years later, when the exiles from Yemen returned from Warsaw and America - the Torah scrolls in their hands remained the same?

How did it happen that a copy of the book of Isaiah from 2000 years ago, stored in the Qumran caves, was found to be identical to the one found in the Bible today?

In order for the Torah to exist forever, and to be accurately transmitted, so that its data can not be distorted, rewritten or erased in retrospective content - not by any man, king, group or force - the Israelites created the first miraculous technology of its kind: interwoven declaration scrolls. This creates a scroll of scrolls, which are interwoven with other scroll of scrolls. Those again are woven into scrolls of scrolls of scrollsâ€¦ repeated until all scrolls are woven into one single "mega scroll". The weaving locks the declarations in the scrolls, and provides them eternal durability. The people repeated the act of copying, storing, and distributing the copies over and over again, in order to unite the "Megillah Megillah" in the first woven mega scroll - the Torah, and later also the Jewish Bible, which survived over 3000 years in its entirety! Over 1.2MB of data! No other ancient dataset of this gigantic size survived perfectly byte-by-byte so years, but for the people of eternity it worked!

LIF imitates this ancient method in the modern computing world. Just like biological imitation engineering: Modern aircraft wing designs imitate bird wings.

LIF is re-implementing this technology, with modern computing: scrolling, ink, scrolling, authentication and time stamping for their digital counterparts: digital scrolls, digital ink (suitable for digital wallet), digital scrolling that opens with inter-scrolling, time stamp by time proof. All in order to ensure that the declarations published in LIF will not be demolished, corrupted or deleted - in fact, LIF guarantees the eternity of the Torah for every declaration that is published in it.

## What is the difference between LIF and Blockchain?
Blockchain was the first to create a trusted and eternal public database. It works, but has huge problems that prevent it to be able to host "the Internet". Blockchains are extremely slow, because every transaction declared requires reaching a consensus of all network members, on the truths of the facts within the declaration. This is their "legal system", which is decided by PoW methods (and other blockchains by PoS method and other decision methods). Legal systems are notoriously slow and expensive, and it is common that an argument over a dollar, ends up costing judicial time and legal expenses of thousands of dollars. In Bitcoin for example, like any legal system, the process of reaching a consensus and a decision involves the work of hundreds of thousands of mining computer "judges", working hard for 10 minutes (up to even an hour!) to decide who the true single owner of a specific dollar. Blockchains today consume 0.6% of the global electricity - more electricity than Argentina!

Therefore it is not useful and cannot be effectively implemented for other uses and applications, other than currency (which, too, the masses cannot use due to the high operating fees for each operation).

Blockchain is a democracy, in which one strives to reach the consensus of the majority, that is, a dictatorship at the end of which the majority imposes its beliefs on the minority. Any majority of more than 50% can prevent you from entering data, or even changing the rules of the network.

The LIF network deals with freedom. Anyone can make declarations (money transfers, and equally uploading live videos of cute catsâ€¦). LIF only makes sure, with the help of the intertwined declaration scrolls method of the Bible - that no one will be able to change the data of your declarations and your signature.

Question: If anyone can declare anything - how can I trust the person who declares that he handed me 10 coins, that indeed these coins were his?

Answer: "Buyer beware": the recipient accepting the digital asset must validate the transaction is valid before accepting the digital asset as valid payment. It is the responsibility of the recipient of the virtual coins to make sure that they are not counterfeit. In the physical world this responsibility is now expressed in checking banknotes to make sure they are not counterfeit when purchasing products in a store, and in the Bible in weighing the silver coins when purchasing a tomb cave.

In LIF, the recipient of the coins must check the historical chain of money transfer declarations in the financial scrolls, and make sure that everything is in order in the chain of transfer of ownership of the coins from the moment they are created until today. If the chain of ownership is proper in the eyes of the buyer, then he will believe the declaration of transfer of the coins, and will agree to give an asset, product or service in return. But if he does not believe and thinks that the coins are not owned by the seller - the buyer will simply ignore the declaration of transfer of coins. The responsibility for review lies with the beneficiary of the declaration, and not with the declarant or a judicial decision-making system.

LIF is independent, unopinionated. The system is not judgmental and does not try to reach a consensus among users, or a decision. The system leaves the decision to each and every user according to his worldview and does not perform a judgment process of the validity of the data.

Just as the attempts to falsify the books of the Bible were retaliated against by the wisdom of the masses, so too the decision on the validity and credibility of the data in the LIF will be made retrospectively by the users of the data. , And whoever is exposed to the data, will decide according to his understanding and beliefs, whether to trust you or not. The LIF network is a platform that will not waste energy for verification and voting processes as in the blockchain. The limitations that exist in today's Internet and blockchain technologies.

## LIF development technical details
LIF is a P2P protocol developed in open source, distributed and censorship-resistant, with JS API to read and write JSON declarations to be stored in scrolls, and distributed and woven with peer scrolls. The code will run on the browser and NodeJS.

This project will be evolutionary and will be run according to the DNA principles created by Derry Shribman, which were the foundation for the success of [Hola](https://hola.org/dna), [Luminati](https://luminati.io/dna), [WebSpark](https://holaspark.com/).

In computer communication networks, peer-to-peer network (Peer to Peer or P2P for short), is a communication network in which each of the ends, functions both as a customer and as a server, and each of the ends is able to initiate or end a call and provide or demand services.

Colleagues make available to other network participants some of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage, or network bandwidth, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. In return, they gain access to their files on other users' computers.

The network functions in a decentralized manner, without the need for mediation or dependence on any major factor. Fellows are participants with equal rights and equal abilities in implementation.
