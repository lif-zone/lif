   "usage2_desc": "If you ever used Facebook, you know how annoying, misleading and wrong are the Fact-checkers (Ugh!). Imagine that Facebook data was saved on LIF and anyone could have developed a Facebook-reader application to show the data. A few users would like to have today's censored (fact-checkers) kind of application. Parents may decide to have an app to hide adult content, while free pepole will choose one that doesn't censoer. Up to you. Remeber Parler that was brought down and all data was erased - It coud never happen with LIF!",
