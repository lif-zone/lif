   "usage3_desc": "Create your indestructible web site.Today, it's very easy to block and censor any site. Countries around the world do it all the time. No more with LIF.",
   "lif_advantages": "What makes it special?",
   "lif_advantages_p1": "LIF is based on proven 3000 years old technology. When Moses wrote the Torah, he needed a way to ensure the data is indestructible or mutated - not by any person, group king or power. He came up with first of a kind technology: woven declaration scrolls. Uniting existing scrolls into a “mega scroll“.",
   "lif_advantages_p2": "This was repeated to unite “mega scrolls” into his first blockchain - the Torah, and later on the Jewish Bible, that survied over 3000 years intact.",
   "lif_advantages_p3": "No other ancient text survived so flawlessly - It worked! Moses succeeded! LIF just reuse the same method, wrapped with cutting-edge encryption, p2p and web technologies. Revolutionary fixing the limitation of today’s Internet and Blockchain technologies.",
   "lif_vs_block": "What’s the difference between LIF and Blockchain?",
   "lif_vs_block_p1": "Blockchain was the first time to create a trustable database network. It works, but it has huge problems. It’s super slow because you need to reach network consensus. All the network members must agree for any transaction. The bigger the network, the slower it is. It consumes tons of energy, rendering it useless for almost any application. Just imagine how much energy is wasted when trying to wire $5.",
   "lif_vs_block_p2": "LIF reuses Moses's woven declaration scrolls. Blockchain is a totalitarian democracy, where the majority enforce its beliefs on the minority. Any >50% majority can block you from inserting data, or even change the rules. LIF is about freedom. Anyone can insert any data. LIF only guarantees that no one can change your data, and that you are the owner of the data. That’s all. No judgement.",
   "lif_vs_block_p3": "The decision on the validity of the data is postponed and decided in retrospective by the one using the data. It’s his responsibility to decide if to believe you or not. LIF lets you declare what you believe, and whoever looks at the data will decide according to his beliefs. LIF doesn’t waste energy to decide consensus.",
