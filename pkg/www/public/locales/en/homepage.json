   "lif_advantages": "What makes it special?",
   "lif_advantages_p1": "LIF is based on proven 3000 years old technology. When Moses wrote the Torah, he needed a way to ensure the Torah's text for eternity - indestructible and never mutated - not by any person, group king or power. He came up with first of a kind technology: woven declaration scrolls. Uniting existing scrolls into a “mega scroll“.",
   "lif_advantages_p2": "This was repeated to unite “mega scrolls” into his first blockchain - the Torah, and later on the Jewish Bible, that survied over 3000 years intact.",
   "lif_advantages_p3": "No other ancient text survived so flawlessly - It worked! Moses succeeded! LIF just reuse the same method, wrapped with cutting-edge cryptography, p2p and web technologies. Revolutionary fixing the limitation of today’s Internet and Blockchain technologies.",
   "lif_vs_block": "LIF vs Blockchain",
   "lif_vs_block_p1": "Blockchain was the first time to create a trustable database network. It works, but it has huge problems. It’s super slow because you need to reach network consensus. All the network members must agree for any transaction. The bigger the network, the slower it is. It consumes tons of energy, rendering it useless for almost any application. Just imagine how much energy is wasted when trying to wire $5.",
   "lif_vs_block_p2": " LIF re-implements Moses' technology, with modern day computing: replacing scrolls, ink, scroll woving, authentication and timestamping into their digital counter-parts: digital-scrolls, digital ink (which corresponds to a digital wallet), digital scroll woving by inter-scroll signing, timestamping by proof-of-order.",
   "lif_vs_block_p3": "Blockchain is a totalitarian democracy, where the majority enforce its beliefs on the minority. Any >50% majority can block you from inserting new information, or even change the rules. LIF is about freedom. Anyone can declare anything. LIF only guarantees that no one can change your declaration, and that you are the one that declared it. That’s all. No judgement. The decision on the validity of the declaration is postponed and decided in retrospective by the one using the declaration. It’s his responsibility to decide if to believe you or not. LIF lets you declare what you believe, and whoever looks at the declaration will decide according to his beliefs. LIF doesn’t waste energy to decide consensus.",
